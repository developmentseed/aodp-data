## Contributing to Afghanistan Open Data

Welcome to the Afghanistan Open Data Project. Below is a guide for participating in the project. Whether you want to use of election data, contribute to opening data, or want to improve the quality of the data, the sections below outline how to start contributing. 

### How to contribute

There are two main ways to contribute to the project: 

1. Make suggestions about data uses and report any errors
2. Contribute new data or improve existing data

### Make suggestions and report errors

Whether you are a technologist, analyst, or interested citizen you can contribute to the project by making suggestions or by reporting any problems. The project uses the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/developmentseed/aodp-data/issues) to manage and discuss reports and questions about the project. 

Suggestions might include new visualizations that you would like to see, data sets that would be useful to open, or sources of data that have not been included. Problems you might encounter might include errors in parsing data, incorrect translations, or improper sourcing of data.

Here's a short list of items to consider before submitting an issue: 

  - Remember that the goal of the site is to open up useful information, not to debate politics. We hope that this data will create healthy conversations about ways to improve the elections and the country. Please don't have those conversations here. There are far better places to discuss interpretations of the data. 
  - Please search for your issue before filing it; some suggestions or problems may have been already reported. Better for you to contribute to that conversation rather than starting a new thread. 
  - If you encountered an error in the data, write specifically what the error is and where we can find the corrected information. Please keep in mind, that some data set are imperfect. For instance, demographic data may be outdated or may utilize imperfect research techniques. That is why it is so important to provide the data source and methodology so that users can judge for themselves. 
  - Please keep issues professional and straightforward. This is an evolving effort and we look to the community to help improve the quality and the process. 


### Contribute and improve data 

The first way to get involved in the Afghanistan Open Data proejct project is to contribute to improving the data. This could involve:

*  Contributing new data,
*  Processing data contributed by someone else to make it easier to use--for instance converting a contributed PDF into a CSV,
*  Combining data sets in ways that create new insight

In all of these cases you would contribute your contributions through a [github pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Data is organized in the `data` folder and is organized by election. Data that is not specific to an election, such as demographic information is stored in the `af_data` folder. The main database for the 2014 elections is in the `2014-president-election.sqlite` file. 

If you contribute new data, please include a note indicating the source of this data. Whenever possible please upload the source data into the relevant folder.
